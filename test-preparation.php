                        <h3>IELTS</h3>
                        <p>IELTS tests all four language skills – listening, reading, writing and speaking. The Speaking test is a face-to-face interview with a certified Examiner. It is interactive and as close to a real-life situation as a test can get. Research shows that IELTS motivates test-takers to develop real and well-rounded English rather than learning by rote. This means your understanding of English is improved and valid for real life in an English-speaking country.</p>

                        <h3>SAT</h3>
                        <p>As the nation’s most widely used college admission test, the SAT is the first step toward higher education for students of all backgrounds. It’s taken by more than two million students every year and is accepted by virtually all colleges and universities. Most university/college in USA use the SAT as one indicator of a student’s readiness to do university-level work. Other criteria include class rank, marks (Grade Point Average), extracurricular activities, personal essays and recommendations. Starting in 1993, the SAT split into the SAT I: Reasoning Test and the SAT II: Subject Tests. In general, universities only require SAT I, but the most exclusive schools often require two or more SAT II Subject Tests.</p>

                        <h3>GRE</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of the GRE is very simple. The GRE is a standardized test, and serves the same purpose that all standardized tests serve–to provide a means of measuring skill level. For admission in US and most Canadian universities GRE act as an admission test which is required for all applicants including American or Canadian students. Why GRE is important because the applicants are from all over the world and when applicant’s university is unknown to graduate admission committee they look to the applicant’s GRE score for evaluating the applicant (and GRE act as a standard for all applicants as everyone has to take it no matter form where applicant did his undergrad/MS from). If GRE score is low and the university is pretty unknown then the chance become very low for acceptance.</p>
