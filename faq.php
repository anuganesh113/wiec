                    <a class="">Why should I study abroad?</a>
                    <p style="display: none;">Study abroad is an enriching and eye-opening adventure, where learning extends far beyond the classroom. The experience will expose you to new ways of thinking, living, and viewing the world. Benefits include the opportunity to learn about another culture firsthand, learn an entirely new language or become fluent in one you have already studied, you can travel, fulfill major and minor coursework requirements, and develop new intellectual pursuits, skills, and perspectives. By living within another culture, you are likely to gain a new understanding and its way of life. You can also expect to make friendships and create memories that will last a lifetime. By studying abroad, you will learn life lessons that could never be taught in class, read in a book, or even taught by your parents. It’s self-empowerment, something you have to strive for….all by yourself. So ready…set…GO.” ~ Kirsten Jolivette, Int’l Business major, Spanish minor,</p>

                    <a class=""> How will a study abroad experience enhance my employability after I graduate?</a>
                    <p style="display: none;">Employers increasingly seek graduates who have international experience, and a study abroad experience will enhance your employability. International knowledge, cross-cultural communication skills, flexibility, resilience, and the ability to adapt to new circumstances are skills enhanced through study abroad that are important to employers in various fields.</p>

                    <a> When should I start planning to study abroad?</a>
                    <p>Early planning is the key to successful study abroad. Hundreds of study abroad opportunities exist; they differ in location, duration, curriculum, language, degree of cultural immersion, cost, and many other factors. In order to find the program that is the right “fit” for your personal and academic objectives, you should begin planning your study abroad experience at least one semester before you actually depart.</p>

                    <a>This is such a big step. How do I talk to my parents about it?</a>
                    <p>The decision to study and live abroad takes a lot of thought. Your parents need to be involved and are bound to have questions. They’ll want to know about KIEC, how serious you are about the program, where you want to go, what you will do there, and especially what you hope to gain from the experience. We can answer the basics as well as offer you tips on approaching your parents about becoming an exchange student. We also offer informative online information sessions.</p>

                    <a>Is credit transfer possible?</a>
                    <p>Yes it is possible. Credits taken at home country can be applied to your major, minor, elective, or general education requirements to abroad. Talk to our academic adviser to identify specific courses that could be targeted for study abroad. Some country accept it and some may not too.</p>

                    <a>What is a Passport?</a>
                    <p>A passport is an international form of identification showing a person’s nationality. It is required of all individuals traveling internationally. If you still do not have a passport, you should obtain one now. Obtaining a Nepalese passport generally takes about 1-4 weeks. Not having a passport can also jeopardize your chances of going abroad since you can’t travel anywhere without one.</p>

                    <a>When should I apply for a passport?</a>
                    <p>If you have not already applied for a passport, apply now! It can take 1 to 4 weeks to receive your passport and you will need it in order to obtain your student visa. You can apply it from your birth place or can get it from Kathmandu on special recommendation from government officials.</p>

                <li>
                    <a>What is a Visa and will I need one?</a>
                    <p>A visa is a stamp or other notation generally placed in your passport that will allow you to enter and temporarily reside in your host country during your program. A visa is required for all Year and Semester Programs and for many of the Summer Programs.</p>

                <li>
                    <a>Are visas hard to obtain?</a>
                    <p>The answer to this question depends upon your destination. For some countries, the process is straightforward and relatively quick, but for other countries, obtaining a visa can be very time consuming and quite expensive. Please note that some visa applications require you to apply in-person at your destination country’s regional consulate. You may be required to travel to the consulate in order to do so. Also, if your program requires you to apply for a student visa, you may have to submit your passport to the consulate along with your visa application and other required document. For this reason, we suggest that you not plan any international trips in the months prior to your departure.</p>

                <li>
                    <a> So if I need a visa, where can I get one?</a>
                    <p>Visas are obtained through the Consular Offices of a country’s Embassy. While most Embassies are in Nepal, there are a number of Consulate Offices located in Kathmandu City. Now a days for some country’s visas are issued from India so that we need to make visa application to their respective authorized courier service will help your document to reach to respective embassy and return back with decision to you.</p>

                <li>
                    <a> How much will they cost?</a>
                    <p>It costs about Rs. 5000 to obtain a passport. It will cost more if you need to receive it faster. Visa application fees can range anywhere depending upon the destination country you have chosen. It is important to remember that in addition to the actual fees charged by the Consulates, some applications require that documents be translated, notarized, and/or legalized. You will be required to pay for these services as well. If you are concerned about visa costs, talk to our Application Advisor about programs and countries with visa fees.</p>

                    <a> What can WIEC do to help me?</a>
                    <p>We provide the service of career counseling under it we examine students qualifications and experiences, profile, preference, socio-economic background, purpose of study and conduct the process of recruitment, counseling and enrollment. Also we support visa documentation and provide updated visa information. It is very critical to up to date on the visa policy because requirements can change suddenly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a> What if the visa is not issued by the time the program departs or not issued at all?</a>
                    <p>Unfortunately, at times these scenarios do happen. Since Consular Officials issue visas, KIEC has no control over these situations or the overall process itself. When these situations occur and aren’t the fault of the student KIEC will help you to resolve the issue reschedule your intakes. If you are denied a visa, KIEC will do everything possible to offer you an alternative program at that time. Since you will not be able to travel before you have secured your visa. In the end, we are sure you will agree that the experience of complete immersion in another culture was worth your efforts.</p>

                    <a> When does the program tuition have to be paid?</a>
                    <p>Some countries has policy to pay the tuition fee and secure the place then apply for the visa like New Zealand, UK etc. and some country has policy that once student secure visa need to pay for the fee like USA etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a> How much luggage can I take?</a>
                    <p>We recommend that you pack a small carry-on bag with a change of clothes, a towel, and personal toiletries. In some cases access to your luggage is restricted during the arrival orientation and it’s important to have these items with you. For safety reasons, most airlines have introduced stiffer carry-on baggage rules. Keep your carry-on bags limited to a backpack or something similar in size. The carry-on bag is limited to 8 inches x 16 inches x 21 inches; and a weight of 32 kilograms. Most airlines will permit passengers to carry a purse, umbrella, or camerain addition to one carry-on bag.</p>

                <li>
                    <a> What should I pack?</a>
                    <p>Research your destination country to learn more about the climate, follow respective website and also you will get best advice from your study abroad counselor from KIEC. The best advice from other KIEC Participants (students) is to take things that you’re comfortable wearing. Avoid trendy outfits—chances are they won’t be in fashion in your destination country and you may feel out of place.</p>
